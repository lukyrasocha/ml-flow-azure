## Intro and Structure

In this report I will discuss how I used `mlflow` (an open source tool for machine learning lifecycle) to pick the best performing model and set of its hyperparameters to predict a power production based on wind weather data (using `mlflow tracking`). Then I will explain how I used `mlflow projects` to package the code for reusability and reproducability and finally how I deployed the best performing model on a `Azure VM` using `mlflow model`. (you can find a thorough description on how to reproduce the entirity of this github repo in the README).
